# qvm
A simulator for quantum algorithms. 

A pure quantum programming language with quantum control dubbed Braqet was developed whose syntax and
semantics and its compiler are described in this [report](https://adelsaleh.github.io/pdfs/qvm.pdf). Alongside is a
tool that was developed to simulate and visualize a Quantum Turing
Machine. To avoid using a hybrid system and to make the quantum
programming experience more realistic we have also developed a quantum virtual machine that runs as a server. 
This [report](https://adelsaleh.github.io/pdfs/qvm.pdf) also details on the development process and the optimization techniques used to
perform the computations.
