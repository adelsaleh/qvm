# qvm
A simulator for quantum algorithms. 

A pure quantum programming language with quantum control dubbed Braqet was developed whose syntax and
semantics and its compiler are described in this [report](https://adelsaleh.github.io/pdfs/qvm.pdf). Alongside is a
tool that was developed to simulate and visualize a Quantum Turing
Machine.
